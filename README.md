# NLP-Web-Scrapped-Drug-Reviews
Natural Language Processing, Reviews on 21 common drugs; Unsupervised learning and Sentiment Analysis 

* In this project, I collected and analyzed approximately 12K reviews of 21 commonly used medications from the web.
* By applying sentiment analysis, I was able to categorize these reviews and extract valuable insights regarding patient experiences.
* A custom fine-tuned model was developed specifically for analyzing sentiment in medical reviews.
* Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques were employed to cluster the data according to common medical conditions within the dataset.
