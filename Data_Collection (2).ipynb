            "Review Description: I had a distal gastric bypass in 1998 and now have bad joints and major back problems, being such a specialized surgery my family Doctor does not understand the major mal-absorption of Opioid Medications (hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination), which in my case, I had 63% of my small intestine bypassed which from what I get on the internet should make my pain med dose nearly twice what it is for a normal person.    Because this is a controlled substance, my hometown family Doctor tells me she cannot give me any more than the standard maximum dose, however now that I am much older I need a higher dose. She also told me that if I go to oxycodone she could not match the dose of hydrocodone.    I have tried to get my situation heard and understood only to find out other Doctors will not even see me because I have a pain contract with my family Doctor, and when I went to the DEA to voice my problems all they did was flag my file as being a possible drug addict or dealer, which it's very hard to get them to remove from your file. It took me three years.    I have tried the FDA and they move slower than the US Mail.    When I first went on hydrocodone it worked and kept me at about a 3 on the pain scale however, now that I am older and the reason I am on pain medication is getting worse, I cannot get a higher dose, and my Doctor simply does not understand anything about my mal-absorption problem with my distal gastric bypass surgery that requires me to have higher doses of nearly all oral drugs, but most importantly I am having the following problems.....  Vomiting,  nausea,    stomach pain,  Dark urine,  a strange light clay look to my stool,  skin rash nearly everywhere that seems not to ever heal,  cannot seem to sleep enough,  dry mouth,  developed asthma,  Itch all over,  dark spots (bumps) that seem to move from place to place,  puss filled eruptions on Skin.
